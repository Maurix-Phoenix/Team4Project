  FlagDescription: 'In the vast realm of sea-bound legends, where pirates and colossal
    sea monsters weave their tales, and untold treasures lie concealed in the depths,
    one enigma stands shrouded in mystery: this flag.

    A relic of unknown origin,
    untouched by human hands, it beckons with a riddle that tugs at the very essence
    of discovery. Who fashioned this cryptic emblem, and from what realm does it
    hail?To unravel the secrets of this enigmatic standard, there remains but a solitary
    path: set sail, brave the unknown, and chart a course toward the answer that
    has eluded all who have gazed upon it.'
