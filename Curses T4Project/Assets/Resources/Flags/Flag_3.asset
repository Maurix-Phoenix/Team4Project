  FlagName: Emanuel Wynne
  FlagDescription: "Born: France\r\nFlagship: Unknown\n\n\r\n\"Emanuel Wynne, the
    enigmatic French pirate, carved a fearsome legacy in the Caribbean, haunting
    vessels and leaving an indelible mark upon pirate history. While much of his
    life remains shrouded in mystery, one tale endures, a tale that has etched his
    name in infamy. Wynne stands as the very first to hoist the Jolly Roger, that
    dread symbol of piracy. It is believed that he was the mastermind behind its
    ominous design, an unmistakable emblem featuring crossbones, accompanied by an
    hourglass, symbolizing the ever-dwindling time of his prey. In the annals of
    piracy, Emanuel Wynne remains an elusive and formidable figure, a phantom of
    the high seas whose legend lives on.\"\n\r"
