  FlagDescription: "Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard\r\nBorn: England\r\nFlagship:
    Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge\n\n\r\n\"In the annals of piracy, none looms as large
    as Edward Teach, the infamous Blackbeard. His reign of terror casted a dark shadow
    over the whole Caribbean and Atlantic american countries. In just under two years,
    he seized over 140 vessels, blockading entire ports and holding them for ransom.
    With a fleet of 400 fierce souls on two sloops and the Queen Anne's Revenge armed
    with 60 cannons, his name struck terror into all. Legends tell of his dreadful
    concoctions, fueling his fury with rum laced with gunpowder and brazenly adorning
    his hat with lit fuses, a hellish spectacle that struck fear into all who crossed
    his path.\u201D\r\n"
