  FlagName: Henry Every
  FlagDescription: "Born: England\r\nFlagship: Fancy\n\n\r\n\u201CHenry Every, crowned
    the 'King of Pirates' by contemporaries, savored a rare fate among his brethren,
    the privilege of escaping with his plunder, untouched by the law or the swords
    of adversaries. He etched his name in the annals of piracy as the mastermind
    behind what is hailed as the most profitable act of piracy in history. Uniting
    with fellow pirates, Every found himself at the helm of a small pirate fleet.
    Under his command, they descended upon a twenty-five-ship convoy of vessels,
    laden with precious metals and jewels. In a whirlwind of plunder, they seized
    a fortune. Though Every's piratical career spanned a mere two years, his exploits
    ignited the imaginations of the masses, inspiring others to follow his path,
    while also birthing literary legends. Every eluded justice, disappearing into
    obscurity. Rumor has it he changed his name and retired, basking in the spoils
    of his tropical island paradise.\"\r\n"
