  FlagDescription: "Known as the Gentleman Pirate\r\nBorn: Barbados\r\nFlagship:
    Revenge\n\n\n\u201CNot all pirates were the fearsome, roughhewn marauders of
    legend. Some were drawn into the daring life of piracy by a sense of adventure,
    even those born to privilege and education. Such was the curious case of Stede
    Bonnet. A landowner with no prior sailing experience, he boldly embraced the
    call of piracy. Commissioning the construction of his vessel, the Revenge, a
    swift sloop armed with ten cannons, Bonnet mustered a crew of 70 souls. Sailing
    alongside the infamous Blackbeard himself, Bonnet's crew plundered countless
    ships. Yet, his inexperience soon tarnished his reputation, sowing discord among
    his men. In short order, Bonnet found himself deserted, his once-loyal crew defecting
    to Blackbeard's ranks, leaving their former captain a 'guest' aboard the Queen
    Anne\u2019s Revenge.\"\r\n"
