  FlagName: Calico Jack
  FlagDescription: 'John Rackham, better known as Calico Jack

    Born: England

    Flagship:
    Kingston




    Calico Jack, so named for his flamboyant red and yellow coat,
    captained the Kingston and etched his name into pirate lore. His daring escapes
    from captivity and infamous partnership with the fearless pirate Anne Bonny are
    the stuff of legend. Together, they plundered countless vessels, amassing great
    wealth on the high seas and eventually becoming lovers.

    Despite his cunning,
    Calico Jack''s luck eventually ran dry, leading to his capture and a grim sentence
    of hanging. As the noose tightened around his neck, Anne Bonny, hiding in the
    crowd, delivered a stern judgment: ''Had you fought as a man, you would not now
    hang like a dog.'' Calico Jack''s tale serves as a stark reminder of the treacherous
    path walked by those who sail under the black flag."
