  FlagName: Bartholomew Roberts
  FlagDescription: "Born: Wales\r\nFlagship: Royal Fortune\n\n\n\"Bartholomew Roberts,
    the legendary Black Bart, claims his rightful place in history as the most prolific
    pirate of all time. With an astounding tally of over 470 captured ships, he commanded
    a formidable fleet of four vessels and a horde of pirates. His leadership prowess,
    charisma, and audacity set him apart. For three relentless years, he roamed the
    high seas, seizing any ship that caught his eye. In response to a mutiny that
    saw a portion of his crew abscond with a sizable share of his riches, Roberts
    penned the renowned 'Robert\u2019s Pirate Code.' He's often depicted in his signature
    attire: a crimson waistcoat, scarlet breeches, and a flamboyant scarlet flamingo
    plume, a living legend among pirates.\"\r\n"
